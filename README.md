# WellSync

## Description

WellSync will merge my two fitness apps, Chronometer and Heavy, into a single platform. Both apps are effective, but integrating workout tracking with calorie monitoring would enhance their functionality for users. Additionally, I want to eliminate the need for user accounts and ads. WellSync will be free and ad-free, prioritizing user privacy and experience.

To achieve this, I plan to use a SQLite database with an export function, allowing users to save their app data, potentially to Google Drive. I will also need to reference a comprehensive food database, which may incur costs to establish and maintain. If user traffic grows significantly, I will need to explore sustainable monetization strategies to cover expenses.

Beyond account management and storage, I aim to incorporate machine learning tools to enhance features. However, this will introduce computational overhead and require investment in server infrastructure, necessitating further financial planning.

Please note that this project is in the very early stages and any feature is subject to change. I am also open to new ideas and collaboration.
